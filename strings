Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings:
----------------------------------

In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

const sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";
output--->Alan said, "Peter is learning JavaScript"

Escape Sequences in Strings
-------------------------------
Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. Escape sequences allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to use in a string.

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	word boundary
\f	form feed

+ operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator

Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
---------------------------------------------------
let ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";  // I come first. I come second..



Constructing Strings with Variables
-------------------------------------
const myName = "hello";
const myStr = "Hi " + myName + " everyone";  //Hi hello eveyone
