Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); 
Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console.
All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. 
When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters.
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
